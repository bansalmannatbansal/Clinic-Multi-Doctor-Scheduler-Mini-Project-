# Clinic-Multi-Doctor-Scheduler-Mini-Project-

Welcome to **Clinic Multi-Doctor Scheduler**!!<br>



## ðŸ©º Project Overview

The **Clinic Multi-Doctor Scheduler** is a Python-based command-line application that allows patients to **book and cancel appointments** with multiple doctors.  <br>
It simulates a real clinicâ€™s scheduling system using **in-memory data storage**, with each doctor having separate time slots.
<br>
This project is the **Phase 1 implementation** â€” a functional CLI version before integrating a **MySQL database** in the next phase.
